Adammantium Multiplayer Mod is a simple Multiplayer Mod for Blade &amp; Sorcery U12.

**Disclaimer: This mod is only a proof of concept atm and buggy as hell. It works, but it's in no way polished.

I never intended the mod to go this far, but well, here we go.
I plan on starting completly from scratch once i figured all the stuff out and implement all the things i learned while i created the mod.
